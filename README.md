### Overview

The project plots word cloud for all the respective emotions. The user can select and train any one of the model (SVM,Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier) and tune the hyper parameters accordingly. 
The project also allows user to predict the emotion on new text. If a user is Hindi speaker he/she can directly input the Hindi text for prediction otherwise an option is provided for him/her to enter the text in English and translate it in Hindi.
